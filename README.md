# Sublime Text snippets
A collection of web development snippets for Sublime Text (2 and 3). 

## Snippet categories
All snippets are arranged in folders corresponding to their category/language.

* Bootstrap 2
* CSS
* Hints - example code with comments that you can use while coding and then delete with one keystroke
* HTML
* JQuery

### Upcoming categories
I'll create and upload more snippets soon in the above categories and the following:

* Bootstrap 3
* Python
* PHP
* Arduino

## How to install snippets

Just drag the snippets folders into your Sublime Text User directory and they should be ready to go. 

You can also select *Browse Packages...* from the Preferences menu, which will take the Packages directory. From there you have access to the User directory.

For more information about how you can create your own snippets, see the <a href="http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/extensibility/snippets.html">Sublime Text Unofficial Documentation</a>.
